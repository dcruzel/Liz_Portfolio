            <p>Hello! I'm Elizabeth D'Cruz, an experienced accountant with over seven years of expertise 
            in financial reporting, reconciliations, and process optimization. My career has equipped 
            me with a strong foundation in accounting and finance, complemented by a recent transition 
            into the tech world through a coding bootcamp at the University of Toronto. I have developed 
            skills in full-stack programming, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and API development.</p>

            <p>My journey in finance has honed my results-driven approach, enabling me to successfully manage 
            complex financial projects while ensuring compliance and accuracy. I've worked with reputable 
            organizations where I led teams in financial analysis, budget preparation, and audit coordination. 
            I pride myself on my strong interpersonal and communication skills, which have allowed me to foster 
            collaborative environments and effectively train clients and colleagues alike.</p>

            <p>I am passionate about merging my financial expertise with my newfound technical skills to drive 
            innovation and efficiency in dynamic work settings. Currently, I am seeking a Senior Accountant 
            role that will allow me to leverage both my accounting knowledge and technical capabilities to contribute 
            to organizational success.</p>

            <p>When I'm not immersed in numbers or coding, you can find me exploring new technologies or indulging my 
            curiosity for learning through online courses and networking events. Let's connect and explore how I 
            can bring value to your team!</p>
